Workplace politics refers to the informal power structures and relationships that exist within an organization, beyond formal job descriptions and hierarchies. It involves the use of influence, persuasion, and networking to achieve personal or group goals, often at the expense of others.

Workplace politics can manifest in various ways, including favoritism, gossiping, backstabbing, and cliques. It can also involve the manipulation of information or resources, as well as the exclusion or marginalization of certain individuals or groups.

While workplace politics can be seen as negative or divisive, it can also have positive aspects. It can facilitate collaboration and innovation, as well as provide opportunities for individuals to showcase their skills and expertise. It can also lead to a more engaged and motivated workforce, as individuals feel they have a stake in the success of the organization.

The impact of workplace politics can be significant, affecting both individuals and organizations. For individuals, workplace politics can lead to stress, burnout, and a sense of disillusionment with the organization. It can also affect career advancement opportunities, as those who are not part of the inner circle may be excluded from important projects or promotions.

For organizations, workplace politics can lead to a toxic work environment, low morale, and high turnover rates. It can also adversely affect productivity and innovation, as individuals may be more focused on personal gain than the success of the organization.
